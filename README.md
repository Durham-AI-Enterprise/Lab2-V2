## Breast Cancer Detection using Keras

This is a simple implementation of a breast cancer detection model using Keras. The code takes in a dataset and preprocesses it using one-hot encoding. The model architecture consists of 4 dense layers with varying activation functions. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function to output binary predictions. The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. The model is then trained on the preprocessed dataset with 100 epochs and a batch size of 16.
